This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile with Python unit tests.  The issue arises from missing shebang lines in test files, preventing the interpreter from executing them correctly within the Docker container. The solution includes adding the shebang to ensure the tests run successfully.
